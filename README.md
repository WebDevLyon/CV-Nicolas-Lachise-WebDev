# Project 1 Openclassrooms

It's simple integration project in HTML and CSS.
I made my CV on January 6, 2020 (it has changed since)

## Exercise instructions

**Instructions:** integrate the model given by Openclassrooms and introduce our informations

![Model](https://user.oc-static.com/upload/2019/04/12/15550721972967_Resume%20-%203.png)

The page must be responsive. No model has been given for this version of the website

## Accomplishment 

I just use HTML5 and Sass. Don't forget to compile the scss with the command.

>npm run sass

I used the flexboxes for the responsive design

For icons, I use the library [Fontawesone](https://fontawesome.com/)
